        <h2>
          Factors that may increase the cost of shipping your car or other
          vehicles are:
        </h2>
        <h3>Size of Vehicle :</h3>
        <p>
          The car delivery cost will increase the bigger the vehicle, as it
          weighs more and occupies more space. Here are some examples of what
          the extra cost would be for a:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SUV - $75</li>
          <li>Large SUV - $125</li>
          <li>Full-Size Truck - $150</li>
          <li>Dually - $250</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our services aren't limited by size; from the smallest and most
          compact vehicle transportation all the way to heavy and large
          vehicles, we can transport it for you. It's not just SUVs or trucks,
          but<br>RVs and military vehicles that can be transported as well!
        </p>
        <h3>Enclosed Vehicle Shipping :</h3>
        <p>
          Enclosed shipment costs will be, on average, 80% more than open auto
          carrier transport. This type of auto shipping should only be chosen
          if your car is extremely expensive, custom, or you're<br>transporting a
          motorsport car. The idea is to protect the car from external
          elements - something that normal cars are already built for.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Steers and brakes - $100</li>
          <li>
            Needs to be forklifted or winched onto a truck - $200 to $500
            depending on the size
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A running vehicle is always more affordable than one that is
          inoperable when it comes to auto transport costs. It's not that it
          needs to be driven when transporting it; it just makes the job
          easier<br>for loading, unloading and reduces maintenance work. Be sure
          to account for this premium when using the instant quote car
          shipping rate calculator.

        <h3>Shipping Options</h3>
        <div class="cont cont-1">
          <h2>Enclosed Vehicle Shipping</h2>
          <p>Enclosed shipment costs will be, on average, 80% more than open auto carrier transport. This type of auto
            shipping should only be chosen if your car is extremely expensive, custom, or you're transporting a

          <h2>
            Expedited Auto Transport
          </h2>
          <p>If you need your car or other vehicle picked up in a short period of time and/or expedited delivery, the
            cost will increase.</p>
          <p>These costs will increase for an expedited delivery because a carrier may have to make changes to their
            schedule or make last-minute adjustments to their plans. This means increased risk, as a driver who
            usually
            takes a route during the day might have to drive through the night with minimum stops.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cont cont-2">
          <h2>Special Requests
          </h2>
          <p>Top loading a vehicle during transport may cost up to $100 more.
          </p>
          <h2>Auto Transport Gap Protection Coverage
          </h2>
          <p>The AFTA PLAN will protect you up to $2000 for out-of-pocket expenses in case a car carrier's insurance
            fails to pay. Adding GAP protection, depending on the coverage, will tack on an additional $48-$98. You
            might think that investing in this plan is not worth the effort, but it is important to note that this
            coverage will protect you not just at the time of delivery, but also if the damage is detected up to 48
            hours afterward.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cont cont-3">
          <h2>Time of Year
          </h2>
          <p>Holiday seasons or bad weather may increase the shipping rate. The instant quote car shipping rate
            calculator will provide a baseline rate that isn't accounting for time of year. High season (Summer) may
            require higher auto shipping rates due to carrier demand. You should be aware during this time that you may
            pay anything from $100 to $800 extra during high and holiday seasons. You can also try to plan your moves
            in
            accordance with the time of year. Spring and fall are some of the most affordable moving times, since there
            isn't as much demand, nor is the weather as intense. You can save up on costs by waiting, but we also
            understand that waiting isn't always possible.
          </p>
          <h2>Economic Conditions

          </h2>
          <p>Gas/Diesel rates, factors into carrier rate adjustments. Expect to pay around $100 to $300 extra during
            economic downturns. The recent COVID-19 situation also led to an increase in prices because of the
            precautions drivers had to take, in addition to mandatory lockdowns. However, this is starting to turn back
            and prices have become more stabilized now.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cont cont-4">
          <h2>Pickup and Delivery Locations
          </h2>
          <p>Remote locations will require car carriers to go outside their well-traveled routes and will likely
            increase the rate. Depending on how far away your location is from large cities or main interstates, you can
            expect to pay close to twice your initial quoted rate.
          </p>
          <p>However, there is always the option of station-to-station delivery, where truck drivers won't have to
            deviate from their route. There are also options to drop your car off at some landmarks that are in the way
            of driver's routes which will significantly reduce costs - but it will require you to pick up the car
            yourself or someone authorized by you.

        <p class="para-1">Need some tips on shipping a car inexpensively? Although the shipping cost varies based on the
          factors
          previously mentioned, there are several ways to lessen the cost. Check out the tips below and take advantage
          of as many as you can!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Use Open Transport:</span> This is the car shipping industry's standard method of shipping cars.
            Cars
            are transported via an open-air tractor-trailer. Open carrier transport is the most affordable option.</li>
          <li><span>Have Your Vehicle in Operable Condition:</span> Double-check to see if your vehicle runs and drives
            before calling a car shipping company. It is more expensive for carriers to handle inoperable cars.</li>

        <h2>Consumer Guide to Standard Car Shipping Rates.
        </h2>
        <h3>It is important to remember that car shipping is not based on fixed rates.
        </h3>
        <p>The rates from the instant quote car transport calculator are purely estimates based on best-case historical
          auto transport shipment costs for the routes and conditions requested. It all depends on the distance from
          pickup and delivery. There is NO fixed rate for any vehicle shipment because of too many variables in the auto
          transport industry.

    <h2>Best Way to Ship a Car - Saving Costs on Car Shipping</h2>
    <p>Moving is one of the most stressful experiences one can go through; even more so if your precious car is
      involved. You may wonder how much does car transport cost?With AmeriFreight, it's as simple as getting in touch
      with us, letting us know where from and where to! Our goal is for you to save money, and to provide excellent auto
      transport services.
    </p>
    <p>Making sure you are working with only the best of the best can be rather difficult, too - which is why we
      recommend you only work with the vehicle moving companies with deep insight into what they're doing. One surefire
      way is to check whether the mover has an A or above rating and offers <a href="">AFTA GAP protection.</a>
    </p>
    <p>It might seem that because of the protection and high rating, companies charge more, but it's quite the contrary.
      The extra bit you pay for GAP protection ensures that should your car be damaged during transit, all damages will
      be covered by the shipping company or <a href="">AFTA</a> - even if it exceeds your insurance amount in some
      cases! Before you
      commit, you should research and read reviews, check services, prices, check our instant quote car shipping rate
      calculator, and most importantly, how they treat their customers. We believe the customer is king, and therefore,
      nothing short of royalty-like treatment gets the job done. But that doesn't mean we charge you like royalty. You
      get what you pay for and more with AmeriFreight!
    </p>
    <p>If you're looking for cheap vehicle transport options, open transport is the way to go. The majority of our
      customers go for this option and are satisfied with the service.
    </p>
    <p>Plus, the free quote we offer on transporting any vehicle, any make and model, anywhere in the US also helps you
      save costs. Remember, we won't just give you an 'estimate' for free, but treat you like our customers even before
      you commit! We want to be your auto transport company.
